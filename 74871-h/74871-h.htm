<p class='c005'>When the naturalist studies the habits, the structure, or the affinities of animals, it
matters little to which group he especially devotes himself; all alike offer him endless
materials for observation and research. But, for the purpose of investigating the phenomena
of geographical distribution and of local or general variation, the several groups
differ greatly in their value and importance. Some have too limited a range, others are
not sufficiently varied in specific forms, while, what is of most importance, many groups
have not received that amount of attention over the whole region they inhabit, which
could furnish materials sufficiently approaching to completeness to enable us to arrive at
any accurate conclusions as to the phenomena they present as a whole. It is in those
groups which are and have long been favourites with collectors that the student of distribution
and variation will find his materials the most satisfactory, from their comparative
completeness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Preeminent among such groups are the diurnal Lepidoptera or Butterflies, whose extreme
beauty and endless diversity have led to their having been assiduously collected in
all parts of the world, and to the numerous species and varieties having been figured in
a series of magnificent works, from those of Cramer, the contemporary of Linn√¶us, down
to the inimitable productions of our own Hewitson. But, besides their abundance, their
universal distribution, and the great attention that has been paid to them, these insects
have other qualities that especially adapt them to elucidate the branches of inquiry already
alluded to. These are the immense development and peculiar structure of the wings,
which not only vary in form more than those of any other insects, but offer on both surfaces
an endless variety of pattern, colouring, and texture. The scales with which they
are more or less completely covered imitate the rich hues and delicate surfaces of satin
or of velvet, glitter with metallic lustre, or glow with the changeable tints of the opal.
This delicately painted surface acts as a register of the minutest differences of organization,‚Äîa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>shade of colour, an additional streak or spot, a slight modification of outline continually
recurring with the greatest regularity and fixity, while the body and all its
other members exhibit no appreciable change. The wings of Butterflies, as Mr. Bates
has well put it<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a>, ‚Äúserve as a tablet on which Nature writes the story of the modifications
of species;‚Äù they enable us to perceive changes that would otherwise be uncertain and
difficult of observation, and exhibit to us on an enlarged scale the effects of the climatal
and other physical conditions which influence more or less profoundly the organization
of every living thing.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. See ‚ÄòThe Naturalist on the Amazons,‚Äô 2nd edit. p. 412.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A proof that this greater sensibility to modifying causes is not imaginary may, I think,
be drawn from the consideration that while the Lepidoptera as a whole are of all insects
the least essentially varied in form, structure, or habits, yet in the number of their specific
forms they are not much inferior to those orders which range over a much wider field of
nature, and exhibit more deeply seated structural modifications. The Lepidoptera are
all vegetable-feeders in their larva-state, and suckers of juices or other liquids in their
perfect form. In their most widely separated groups they differ but little from a common
type, and offer comparatively unimportant modifications of structure or of habits.
The Coleoptera, the Diptera, or the Hymenoptera, on the other hand, present far greater
and more essential variations. In either of these orders we have both vegetable- and
animal-feeders, aquatic, and terrestrial, and parasitic groups. Whole families are devoted
to special departments in the economy of nature. Seeds, fruits, bones, carcases, excrement,
bark, have each their special and dependent insect tribes from among them; whereas the
Lepidoptera are, with but few exceptions, confined to the one function of devouring the
foliage of living vegetation. We might therefore anticipate that their population would
be only equal to those of the sections of the other orders that have a similar uniform
mode of existence; and the fact that their numbers are at all comparable with those
of entire orders, so much more varied in organization and habits, is, I think, a proof
that they are in general highly susceptible of specific modification.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Papilionid√¶ are a family of diurnal Lepidoptera which have hitherto, by almost
universal consent, held the first rank in the order; and though this position has recently
been denied them, I cannot altogether acquiesce in the reasoning by which it has been
proposed to degrade them to a lower rank. In Mr. Bates‚Äôs most excellent paper on the
Heliconid√¶<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a>, he claims for that family the highest position, chiefly because of the imperfect
structure of the fore legs, which is there carried to an extreme degree of abortion,
and thus removes them further than any other family from the Hesperid√¶ and Heterocera,
which all have perfect legs. Now it is a question whether any amount of difference
which is exhibited merely in the imperfection or abortion of certain organs, can establish
in the group exhibiting it a claim to a high grade of organization; still less can this be
allowed when another group, along with perfection of structure in the same organs,
exhibits modifications peculiar to it, together with the possession of an organ which in
the remainder of the order is altogether wanting. This is, however, the position of the
Papilionid√¶. The perfect insects possess two characters quite peculiar to them. Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Edward Doubleday, in his ‚ÄòGenera of Diurnal Lepidoptera,‚Äô says, ‚ÄúThe Papilionid√¶
may be known by the apparently four-branched median nervule and the spur on the
anterior tibi√¶, characters found in no other family.‚Äù The four-branched median nervule
is a character so constant, so peculiar, and so well marked, as to enable a person to tell,
at a glance at the wings only of a butterfly, whether it does or does not belong to this
family; and I am not aware that any other group of Butterflies, at all comparable to this
in extent and modifications of form, possesses a character in its neuration to which the
same degree of certainty can be attached. The spur on the anterior tibi√¶ is also found
in some of the Hesperid√¶, and is therefore supposed to show a direct affinity between the
two groups; but I do not imagine it can counterbalance the differences in neuration and
in every other part of their organization. The most characteristic feature of the Papilionid√¶,
however, and that on which I think insufficient stress has been laid, is undoubtedly
the peculiar structure of the larv√¶. These all possess an extraordinary organ
situated on the neck, the well-known <span class='blackletter'><b>Y</b></span>-shaped tentacle, which is entirely concealed in a
state of repose, but which is capable of being suddenly thrown out by the insect when
alarmed. When we consider this singular apparatus, which in some species is nearly
half an inch long, the arrangement of muscles for its protrusion and retraction, its perfect
concealment during repose, its blood-red colour, and the suddenness with which it
can be thrown out, we must, I think, be led to the conclusion that it serves as a protection
to the larva by startling and frightening away some enemy when about to seize
it, and is thus one of the causes which has led to the wide extension and maintained
the permanence of this now dominant group. Those who believe that such peculiar
structures can only have arisen by very minute successive variations, each one advantageous
to its possessor, must see, in the possession of such an organ by one group, and
its complete absence in every other, a proof of a very ancient origin and of very long-continued
modification. And such a positive structural addition to the organization of
the family, subserving an important function, seems to me alone sufficient to warrant us
in considering the Papilionid√¶ as the most highly developed portion of the whole order,
and thus in retaining it in the position which the size, strength, beauty, and general
structure of the perfect insects have been generally thought to deserve.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Papilionid√¶ are pretty widely distributed over the earth, but are especially abundant
in the tropics, where they attain their maximum of size and beauty and the greatest
variety of form and colouring. South America, North India, and the Malay Islands are
the regions where these fine insects occur in the greatest profusion, and where they
actually become a not unimportant feature in the scenery. In the Malay Islands in particular
the giant Ornithopter√¶ may be frequently seen about the borders of the cultivated
and forest districts, their large size, stately flight, and gorgeous colouring rendering them
even more conspicuous than the generality of birds. In the shady suburbs of the town
of Malacca two large and handsome Papilios (<i>Memnon</i> and <i>Nephelus</i>) are not uncommon,
flapping with irregular flight along the roadway, or, in the early morning, expanding
their wings to the invigorating rays of the sun. In Amboyna and other towns of the
Moluccas, the magnificent <i>Deiphobus</i> and <i>Severus</i>, and occasionally even the azure-winged
<i>Ulysses</i>, frequent similar situations, fluttering about the orange-trees and flower-beds, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>sometimes even straying into the narrow bazaars or covered markets of the city. In
Java the golden-dusted <i>Arjuna</i> may often be seen at damp places on the roadside in the
mountain districts, in company with <i>Sarpedon</i>, <i>Bathycles</i>, and <i>Agamemnon</i>, and less frequently
the beautiful swallow-tailed <i>Antiphates</i>. In the more luxuriant parts of these
islands one can hardly take a morning‚Äôs walk in the neighbourhood of a town or village
without seeing three or four species of <i>Papilio</i>, and often twice that number. No less
than 120 species of the family are now known to inhabit the Archipelago, and of these
ninety-six were collected by myself. Twenty-nine species are found in Borneo, being the
largest number in any one island, twenty-three species having been obtained by myself
in the vicinity of Sarawak; Java has twenty-seven species; Celebes and the Peninsula
of Malacca twenty-three each. Further east the numbers decrease, Batchian producing
seventeen, and New Guinea only thirteen, though this number is certainly too small,
owing to our present imperfect knowledge of that great island.</p>

<p class='c006'>In estimating these numbers I have had the usual difficulty to encounter, of determining
what to consider species and what varieties. The Malayan region, consisting of a large
number of islands of generally great antiquity, possesses, compared to its actual area, a
great number of distinct forms, often indeed distinguished by very slight characters, but
in most cases so constant in large series of specimens, and so easily separable from each
other, that I know not on what principle we can refuse to give them the name and rank
of species. One of the best and most orthodox definitions is that of Pritchard, the great
ethnologist, who says, that ‚Äú<i>separate origin and distinctness of race, evinced by a constant
transmission of some characteristic peculiarity of organization</i>,‚Äù constitutes a species.
Now leaving out the question of ‚Äúorigin,‚Äù which we cannot determine, and taking only
the proof of separate origin, ‚Äú<i>the constant transmission of some characteristic peculiarity
of organization</i>,‚Äù we have a definition which will compel us to neglect altogether the
<i>amount</i> of difference between any two forms, and to consider only whether the differences
that present themselves are <i>permanent</i>. The rule, therefore, I have endeavoured to adopt
is, that when the difference between two forms inhabiting separate areas seems quite
constant, when it can be defined in words, and when it is not confined to a single peculiarity
only, I have considered such forms to be species. When, however, the individuals
of each locality vary among themselves, so as to cause the distinctions between the two
forms to become inconsiderable and indefinite, or where the differences, though constant,
are confined to one particular only, such as size, tint, or a single point of difference in
marking or in outline, I class one of the forms as a variety of the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>I find as a general rule that the constancy of species is in an inverse ratio to their range.
Those which are confined to one or two islands are generally very constant. When they
extend to many islands, considerable variability appears; and when they have an extensive
range over a large part of the Archipelago, the amount of unstable variation is very
large. These facts are explicable on Mr. Darwin‚Äôs principles. When a species exists
over a wide area, it must have had, and probably still possesses, great powers of dispersion.
Under the different conditions of existence in various portions of its area, different
variations from the type would be selected, and, were they completely isolated, would soon
become distinctly modified forms; but this process is checked by the dispersive powers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>of the whole species, which leads to the more or less frequent intermixture of the incipient
varieties, which thus become irregular and unstable. Where, however, a species
has a limited range, it indicates less active powers of dispersion, and the process of modification
under changed conditions is less interfered with. The species will therefore exist
under one or more permanent forms according as portions of it have been isolated at a
more or less remote period.</p>

<p class='c006'>What is commonly called variation consists of several distinct phenomena which have
been too often confounded. I shall proceed to consider these under the heads of‚Äî1st,
simple variability; 2nd, polymorphism; 3rd, local forms; 4th, coexisting varieties; 5th,
races or subspecies; and 6th, true species.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Simple variability.</i>‚ÄîUnder this head I include all those cases in which the specific
form is to some extent unstable. Throughout the whole range of the species, and even
in the progeny of individuals, there occur continual and uncertain differences of form,
analogous to that variability which is so characteristic of domestic breeds. It is impossible
usefully to define any of these forms, because there are indefinite gradations to each other
form. Species which possess these characteristics have always a wide range, and are more
frequently the inhabitants of continents than of islands, though such cases are always
exceptional, it being far more common for specific forms to be fixed within very narrow
limits of variation. The only good example of this kind of variability which occurs among
the Malayan Papilionid√¶ is in <i>Papilio Severus</i>, a species inhabiting all the islands of
the Moluccas and New Guinea, and exhibiting in each of them a greater amount of individual
difference than often serves to distinguish well-marked species. Almost equally
remarkable are the variations exhibited in most of the species of <i>Ornithoptera</i>, which I
have found in some cases to extend even to the form of the wing and the arrangement of
the nervures. Closely allied, however, to these variable species are others which, though
differing slightly from them, are constant and confined to limited areas. After satisfying
oneself, by the examination of numerous specimens captured in their native countries,
that the one set of individuals are variable and the others are not, it becomes evident that
by classing all alike as varieties of one species we shall be obscuring an important fact
in nature, and that the only way to exhibit that fact in its true light is to treat the invariable
local form as a distinct species, even though it does not offer better distinguishing
characters than do the extreme forms of the variable species. Cases of this kind are
the <i>Ornithoptera Priamus</i>, which is confined to the islands of Ceram and Amboyna, and is
very constant in both sexes, while the allied species inhabiting New Guinea and the
Papuan Islands is exceedingly variable; and in the island of Celebes is a species closely
allied to the variable <i>P. Severus</i>, but which, being exceedingly constant, I have described
as a distinct species under the name of <i>Papilio Pertinax</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. <i>Polymorphism or dimorphism.</i>‚ÄîBy this term I understand the coexistence in the
same locality of two or more distinct forms, not connected by intermediate gradations,
and all of which are occasionally produced from common parents. These distinct forms
generally occur in the female sex only, and the intercrossing of two of these forms does
not generate an intermediate race, but reproduces the same forms in varying proportions.
I believe it will be found that a considerable number of what have been classed as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span><i>varieties</i> are really cases of <i>polymorphism</i>. Albinoism and melanism are of this character,
as well as most of those cases in which well-marked varieties occur in company with the
parent species, but without any intermediate forms. Under these circumstances, if the
two forms breed separately, and are never reproduced from a common parent, they must
be considered as distinct species, contact without intermixture being a good test of
specific difference. On the other hand, intercrossing without producing an intermediate
race is a test of dimorphism. I consider, therefore, that under any circumstances the
term ‚Äòvariety‚Äô is wrongly applied to such cases.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Malayan Papilionid√¶ exhibit some very curious instances of polymorphism, some
of which have been recorded as varieties, others as distinct species; and they all occur in
the female sex. <i>Papilio Memnon</i>, L., is one of the most striking, as it exhibits the
mixture of simple variability, local and polymorphic forms, all hitherto classed under the
common title of varieties. The polymorphism is strikingly exhibited by the females, one
set of which resemble the males in form, with a variable paler colouring; the others have
a large spatulate tail to the hinder wings and a distinct style of colouring, which causes
them closely to resemble <i>P. Coon</i>, a species of which the sexes are alike and inhabiting
the same countries, but with which they have no direct affinity. The tailless females
exhibit simple variability, scarcely two being found exactly alike even in the same
locality. The males of the island of Borneo exhibit constant differences of the under
surface, and may therefore be distinguished as a local form, while the continental specimens,
as a whole, offer such large and constant differences from those of the islands that
I am inclined to separate them as a distinct species‚Äî<i>P. Androgeus</i>, Cr. We have here,
therefore, distinct species, local forms, polymorphism, and simple variability, which seem
to me to be distinct phenomena, but which have been hitherto all classed together as
varieties. I may mention that the fact of these distinct forms being one species is doubly
proved. The males, the tailed and tailless females, have all been bred from a single
group of the larv√¶, by Messrs. Payen and Bocarm√©, in Java, and I myself captured in
Sumatra a male <i>P. Memnon</i>, L., and a tailed female <i>P. Achates</i>, Cr., ‚Äúin copul√¢.‚Äù</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Papilio Pammon</i>, L., offers a somewhat similar case. The female was described by
Linn√¶us as <i>P. Polytes</i>, and was considered to be a distinct species till Westermann bred
the two from the same larv√¶ (see Boisduval, ‚ÄòSpecies G√©n√©rales des L√©pidopt√®res,‚Äô p. 272).
They were therefore classed as sexes of one species by Mr. Edward Doubleday, in his
‚ÄòGenera of Diurnal Lepidoptera,‚Äô in 1846. Later, female specimens were received from
India closely resembling the male insect, and this was held to overthrow the authority of
M. Westermann‚Äôs observation, and to reestablish <i>P. Polytes</i> as a distinct species; and as
such it accordingly appears in the British Museum List of Papilionid√¶ in 1856, and in
the Catalogue of the East India Museum in 1857. This discrepancy is explained by the
fact of <i>P. Pammon</i> having two females, one closely resembling the male, while the other
is totally different from it. A long familiarity with this insect (which, replaced by local
forms or by closely allied species, occurs in every island of the Archipelago) has convinced
me of the correctness of this statement; for in every place where a male allied to
<i>P. Pammon</i> is found, a female resembling <i>P. Polytes</i> also occurs, and sometimes, though
less frequently than on the continent, another female closely resembling the male; while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>not only has no male specimen of <i>P. Polytes</i> yet been found, but the female (<i>Polytes</i>) has
never yet been found in localities to which the male (<i>Pammon</i>) does not extend. In this
case, as in the last, distinct species, local forms, and dimorphic specimens have been confounded
under the common appellation of varieties.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, besides the true <i>P. Polytes</i>, there are several allied forms of females to be considered,
namely, <i>P. Theseus</i>, Cr., <i>P. Melanides</i>, De Haan, <i>P. Elyros</i>, G. R. G., and
<i>P. Romulus</i>, L. The dark female figured by Cramer as <i>P. Theseus</i> seems to be the common
and perhaps the only form in Sumatra, whereas in Java, Borneo, and Timor, along
with males quite identical with those of Sumatra, occur females of the <i>Polytes</i> form,
although a single specimen of the true <i>P. Theseus</i>, Cr., taken at Lombock would seem to
show that the two forms do occur together. In the allied species found in the Philippine
‚ôÄIslands (<i>P. Alphenor</i>, Cr., <i>P. Ledebouria</i>, Eschsch., ‚ôÄ <i>P. Elyros</i>, G. R. G.) forms corresponding
to these extremes occur along with a number of intermediate varieties, as shown
by a fine series in the British Museum. We have here an indication of how dimorphism
may be produced; for let the extreme Philippine forms be better suited to their conditions
of existence than the intermediate connecting links, and the latter will gradually
die out, leaving two distinct forms of the same insect, each adapted to some special conditions.
As these conditions are sure to vary in different districts, it will often happen,
as in Sumatra and Java, that the one form will predominate in the one island, the other
in the adjacent one. In the island of Borneo there seems to be a third form; for <i>P. Melanides</i>,
De Haan, evidently belongs to this group, and has all the chief characteristics of
<i>P. Theseus</i>, with a modified coloration of the hind wings. I now come to an insect
which, if I am correct, offers one of the most interesting cases of variation yet adduced.
<i>Papilio Romulus</i>, L., a butterfly found over a large part of India and Ceylon, and not
uncommon in collections, has always been considered a true and independent species,
and no suspicions have been expressed regarding it. But a male of this form does not, I
believe, exist. I have examined the fine series in the British Museum, in the East India
Company‚Äôs Museum, in the Hope Museum at Oxford, in Mr. Hewitson‚Äôs and several other
private collections, and can find nothing but females; and for this common butterfly no
male partner can be found except the equally common <i>P. Pammon</i>, a species already
provided with two wives, and yet to whom we shall be forced, I believe, to assign a third.
On carefully examining <i>P. Romulus</i>, I find that in all essential characters,‚Äîthe form and
texture of the wings, the length of the antenn√¶, the spotting of the head and thorax, and
even the peculiar tints and shades with which it is ornamented,‚Äîit corresponds exactly
with the other females of the <i>Pammon</i> group; and though, from the peculiar marking of
the fore wings, it has at first sight a very different aspect, yet a closer examination shows
that every one of its markings could be produced by slight and almost imperceptible
modifications of the various allied forms. I fully believe, therefore, that I shall be
correct in placing <i>P. Romulus</i> as a third Indian form of the female <i>P. Pammon</i>, corresponding
to <i>P. Melanides</i>, the third form of the Malayan <i>P. Theseus</i>. I may mention
here that the females of this group have a superficial resemblance to the <i>Polydorus</i>
group, as shown by <i>P. Theseus</i> having been considered to be the female of <i>P. Antiphus</i>,
and by <i>P. Romulus</i> being arranged next to <i>P. Hector</i>. There is no close affinity between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>these two groups of <i>Papilio</i>, and I am disposed to believe that we have here a case of
mimicry, brought about by the same causes which Mr. Bates has so well explained in his
account of Heliconid√¶, and which thus led to the singular exuberance of polymorphic
forms in this and allied groups of the genus <i>Papilio.</i> I shall have to devote a section of
my paper to the consideration of this subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>The third example of polymorphism I have to bring forward is <i>Papilio Ormenus</i>,
Gu√©r., which is closely allied to the well-known <i>P. Erechtheus</i>, Don., of Australia. The
most common form of the female also resembles that of <i>P. Erechtheus</i>; but a totally
different-looking insect was found by myself in the Aru Islands, and figured by Mr.
Hewitson under the name of <i>P. Onesimus</i>, which subsequent observation has convinced
me is a second form of the female of <i>P. Ormenus</i>. Comparison of this with Boisduval‚Äôs
description of <i>P. Amanga</i>, a specimen of which from New Guinea is in the Paris
Museum, shows the latter to be a closely similar form; and two other specimens were
obtained by myself, one in the island of Goram and the other in Waigiou, all evidently
local modifications of the same form. In each of these localities males and ordinary
females of <i>P. Ormenus</i> were also found. So far there is no evidence that these light-coloured
insects are not females of a distinct species, the males of which have not been
discovered. But two facts have convinced me this is not the case. At Dorey, in New
Guinea, where males and ordinary females closely allied to <i>P. Ormenus</i> occur (but which
seem to me worthy of being separated as a distinct species), I found one of these light-coloured
females closely followed in her flight by three males, exactly in the same manner
as occurs (and, I believe, occurs only) with the sexes of the same species. After watching
them a considerable time, I captured the whole of them, and became satisfied that I
had discovered the true relations of this anomalous form. The next year I had corroborative
proof of the correctness of this opinion by the discovery in the island of Batchian
of a new species allied to <i>P. Ormenus</i>, all the females of which, either seen or
captured by me, were of one form, and much more closely resembling the abnormal
light-coloured females of <i>P. Ormenus</i> and <i>P. Pandion</i> than the ordinary specimens of
that sex. Every naturalist will, I think, agree that this is strongly confirmative of the
supposition that both forms of female are of one species; and when we consider, further,
that in four separate islands, in each of which I resided for several months, the two forms
of female were obtained and only one form of male ever seen, and that about the same
time M. Montrouzier in Woodlark Island, at the other extremity of New Guinea (where
he resided several years, and must have obtained all the large Lepidoptera of the island),
obtained females closely resembling mine, which, in despair at finding no appropriate
partners for them, he mates with a widely different species,‚Äîit becomes, I think,
sufficiently evident that this is another case of polymorphism of the same nature as
those already pointed out in <i>P. Pammon</i> and <i>P. Memnon</i>. This species, however, is
not only <i>dimorphic</i>, but <i>trimorphic</i>; for, in the island of Waigiou, I obtained a third
female quite distinct from either of the others, and in some degree intermediate between
the ordinary female and the male. The specimen is particularly interesting to those
who believe, with Mr. Darwin, that extreme difference of the sexes has been gradually
produced by what he terms sexual selection, since it may be supposed to exhibit one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the intermediate steps in that process which has been accidentally preserved in company
with its more favoured rivals, though its extreme rarity (only one specimen having been
seen to many hundreds of the other form) would indicate that it may soon become extinct.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only other case of polymorphism in the genus <i>Papilio</i>, at all equal in interest to
those I have now brought forward, occurs in America; and we have, fortunately, accurate
information about it. <i>Papilio Turnus</i>, L., is common over almost the whole of
temperate North America; and the female resembles the male very closely. A totally
different-looking insect both in form and colour, <i>Papilio Glaucus</i>, L., inhabits the same
region; and though, down to the time when Boisduval published his ‚ÄòSpecies G√©n√©ral,‚Äô
no connexion was supposed to exist between the two species, it is now well ascertained that
<i>P. Glaucus</i> is a second female form of <i>P. Turnus</i>. In the ‚ÄòProceedings of the Entomological
Society of Philadelphia,‚Äô Jan. 1863, Mr. Walsh gives a very interesting account of the
distribution of this species. He tells us that in the New England States and in New York
all the females are yellow, while in Illinois and further south all are black; in the intermediate
region both black and yellow females occur in varying proportions. Lat. 37¬∞ is
approximately the southern limit of the yellow form, and 42¬∞ the northern limit of the black
form; and, to render the proof complete, both black and yellow insects have been bred
from a single batch of eggs. He further states that, out of thousands of specimens, he
has never seen or heard of intermediate varieties between these forms. In this interesting
example we see the effects of latitude in determining the proportions in which the individuals
of each form should exist. The conditions are <i>here</i> favourable to the one form, <i>there</i>
to the other; but we are by no means to suppose that these conditions consist in climate
alone. It is highly probable that the existence of enemies, and of competing forms of life,
may be the main determining influences; and it is much to be wished that such a competent
observer as Mr. Walsh would endeavour to ascertain what are the adverse causes
which are most efficient in keeping down the numbers of each of these contrasted forms.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dimorphism of this kind in the animal kingdom does not seem to have any direct
relations to the reproductive powers, as Mr. Darwin has shown to be the case in plants, nor
does it appear to be very general. One other case only is known to me in another family
of my eastern Lepidoptera, the <i>Pierul√¶</i>; and but few occur in the Lepidoptera of other
countries. The spring and autumn broods of some European species differ very remarkably;
and this must be considered as a phenomenon of an analogous though not of an identical
nature<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a>. <i>Araschnia prorsa</i>, of Central Europe, is a striking example of this alternate or
seasonal dimorphism. Mr. Pascoe has pointed out two forms of the male sex in some
species of Coleoptera belonging to the family Anthribid√¶, in seven species of the two
genera <i>Xenocerus</i> and <i>Mecocerus</i> (Proc. Ent. Soc. Lond., 1862, p. 71); and no less than
six European Water-beetles, of the genus <i>Dytiscus</i>, have females of two forms, the most
common having the elytra deeply sulcate, the rarer smooth as in the males. The three,
and sometimes four or more, forms under which many Hymenopterous insects (especially
Ants) occur must be considered as a related phenomenon, though here each form is specialized
to a distinct function in the economy of the species. Among the higher animals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>albinoism and melanism may, as I have already stated, be considered as analogous facts;
and I met with one case of a bird, a species of Lory (<i>Eos fuscata</i>, Blyth), clearly existing
under two forms, since I obtained both sexes of each from a single flock.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Among our nocturnal Lepidoptera, I am informed, many analogous cases occur; and as the whole history of
many of these has been investigated by breeding successive generations from the egg, it is to be hoped that some of
our British Lepidopterists will give us a connected account of all the abnormal phenomena which they present.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The fact of the two sexes of one species differing very considerably is so common, that
it attracted but little attention till Mr. Darwin showed how it could in many cases be
explained by what he termed sexual selection. For instance, in most polygamous animals
the males fight for the possession of the females, and the victors, always becoming the
progenitors of the succeeding generation, impress upon their male offspring their own
superior size, strength, or unusually developed offensive weapons. It is thus that we can
account for the spurs and the superior strength and size of the males in Gallinaceous
birds, and also for the large canine tusks in the males of fruit-eating Apes. So the
superior beauty of plumage and special adornments of the males of so many birds
can be explained by supposing (what there are many facts to prove) that the females
prefer the most beautiful and perfect-plumaged males, and that thus slight accidental variations
of form and colour have been accumulated till they have produced the wonderful
train of the Peacock and the gorgeous plumage of the Bird of Paradise. Both these
causes have no doubt acted partially in insects, so many species possessing horns and powerful
jaws in the male sex only, and still more frequently the males alone rejoicing in rich
colours or sparkling lustre. But there is here another cause which has led to sexual
differences, viz. a special adaptation of the sexes to diverse habits or modes of life. This
is well seen in female Butterflies (which are generally weaker and of slower flight), often
having colours better adapted to concealment; and in certain South American species
(<i>Papilio torquatus</i>) the females, which inhabit the forests, resemble the <i>√Üneas</i> group,
which abound in similar localities, while the males, which frequent the sunny open riverbanks,
have a totally different coloration. In these cases, therefore, natural selection
seems to have acted independently of sexual selection; and all such cases may be considered
as examples of the simplest dimorphism, since the offspring never offer intermediate
varieties between the parent forms.</p>

<p class='c006'>The distinctive character therefore of dimorphism is this, that the union of these distinct
forms does not produce intermediate varieties, but reproduces them unchanged.
In simple varieties, on the other hand, as well as when distinct local forms or distinct
species are crossed, the offspring never resembles either parent exactly, but is more or
less intermediate between them. Dimorphism is thus seen to be a specialized result of
variation, by which new physiological phenomena have been developed; the two should
therefore, whenever possible, be kept separate<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c007'><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. The phenomena of <i>dimorphism</i> and <i>polymorphism</i> may be well illustrated by supposing that a blue-eyed, flaxen-haired
Saxon man had two wives, one a black-haired, red-skinned Indian squaw, the other a woolly-headed, sooty-skinned
negress‚Äîand that instead of the children being mulattoes of brown or dusky tints, mingling the separate
characteristics of their parents in varying degrees, all the boys should be pure Saxon boys like their father, while the
girls should altogether resemble their mothers. This would be thought a sufficiently wonderful fact; yet the phenomena
here brought forward as existing in the insect-world are still more extraordinary; for each mother is capable
not only of producing male offspring like the father, and female like herself, but also of producing other females
exactly like her fellow-wife, and altogether differing from herself. If an island could be stocked with a colony of
human beings having similar physiological idiosyncrasies with <i>Papilio Pammon</i> or <i>Papilio Ormenus</i>, we should see
white men living with yellow, red, and black women, and their offspring always reproducing the same types; so that
at the end of many generations the men would remain pure white, and the women of the same well-marked races as
at the commencement.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>3. <i>Local form, or variety.</i>‚ÄîThis is the first step in the transition from variety to species.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>It occurs in species of wide range, when groups of individuals have become partially
isolated in several points of its area of distribution, in each of which a characteristic
form has become segregated more or less completely. Such forms are very common in
all parts of the world, and have often been classed as varieties or species alternately. I
restrict the term to those cases where the difference of the forms is very slight, or where
the segregation is more or less imperfect. The best example in the present group is
<i>Papilio Agamemnon</i>, L., a species which ranges over the greater part of tropical Asia,
the whole of the Malay archipelago, and a portion of the Australian and Pacific regions.
The modifications are principally of size and form, and, though slight, are tolerably constant
in each locality. The steps, however, are so numerous and gradual that it would
be impossible to define many of them, though the extreme forms are sufficiently distinct.
<i>Papilio Sarpedon</i>, L., presents somewhat similar but less numerous variations.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. <i>Coexisting variety.</i>‚ÄîThis is a somewhat doubtful case. It is when a slight but permanent
and hereditary modification of form exists in company with the parent or typical
form, without presenting those intermediate gradations which would constitute it a case
of simple variability. It is evidently only by direct evidence of the two forms breeding
separately that this can be distinguished from <i>dimorphism</i>. The difficulty occurs in <i>Papilio
Jason</i>, Esp., and <i>P. Evemon</i>, Bd., which inhabit the same localities, and are almost
exactly alike in form, size, and coloration, except that the latter always wants a very
conspicuous red spot on the under surface, which is found not only in <i>P. Jason</i>, but in all
the allied species. It is only by breeding the two insects that it can be determined whether
this is a case of a coexisting variety or of <i>dimorphism</i>. In the former case, however,
the difference being constant and so very conspicuous and easily defined, I see not how
we could escape considering it as a distinct species. A true case of coexisting forms
would, I consider, be produced, if a slight variety had become fixed as a local form, and
afterwards been brought into contact with the parent species with little or no intermixture
of the two; and such instances do very probably occur.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. <i>Race, or subspecies.</i>‚ÄîThese are local forms completely fixed and isolated; and there
is no possible test but individual opinion to determine which of them shall be considered
as species and which varieties. If stability of form and ‚Äú<i>the constant transmission of
some characteristic peculiarity of organization</i>‚Äù is the test of a species (and I can find
no other test that is more certain than individual opinion), then every one of these fixed
races, confined as they almost always are to distinct and limited areas, must be regarded
as a species; and as such I have in most cases treated them. The various modifications of
<i>Papilio Ulysses</i>, <i>P. Peranthus</i>, <i>P. Codrus</i>, <i>P. Eurypilus</i>, <i>P. Helenus</i>, &#38;c., are excellent
examples; for while some present great and well-marked, others offer slight and inconspicuous
differences, yet in all cases these differences seem equally fixed and permanent.
If, therefore, we call some of these forms species, and others varieties, we introduce a
purely arbitrary distinction, and shall never be able to decide where to draw the line.
The races of <i>Papilio Ulysses</i>, L., for example, vary in amount of modification from the
scarcely differing New Guinea form to those of Woodlark Island and New Caledonia, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>all seem equally constant; and as most of these had already been named and described
as species, I have added the New Guinea form under the name of <i>P. Penelope</i>. We thus
get a little group of Ulyssine Papilios, the whole comprised within a very limited area, each
one confined to a separate portion of that area, and, though differing in various amounts,
each apparently constant. Few naturalists will doubt that all these may and probably
have been derived from a common stock; and therefore it seems desirable that there
should be a unity in our method of treating them: either call them all <i>varieties</i> or all
<i>species</i>. Varieties, however, continually get overlooked; in lists of species they are often
altogether unrecorded; and thus we are in danger of neglecting the interesting phenomena
of variation and distribution which they present. I think it advisable, therefore, to name
all such forms; and those who will not accept them as species may consider them as subspecies
or races.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. <i>Species.</i>‚ÄîSpecies are merely those strongly marked races or local forms which, when
in contact, do not intermix, and when inhabiting distinct areas are generally believed to
have had a separate origin, and to be incapable of producing a fertile hybrid offspring.
But as the test of hybridity cannot be applied in one case in ten thousand, and even if it
could be applied, would prove nothing, since it is founded on an assumption of the very
question to be decided‚Äîand as the test of separate origin is in every case inapplicable‚Äîand
as, further, the test of non-intermixture is useless, except in those rare cases where
the most closely allied species are found inhabiting the same area, it will be evident
that we have no means whatever of distinguishing so-called ‚Äútrue species‚Äù from the
several modes of variation here pointed out, and into which they so often pass by an
insensible gradation. It is quite true that, in the great majority of cases, what we term
‚Äúspecies‚Äù are so well marked and definite that there is no difference of opinion about
them; but as the test of a true theory is, that it accounts for, or at the very least is not
inconsistent with, the whole of the phenomena and apparent anomalies of the problem
to be solved, it is reasonable to ask that those who deny the origin of species by variation
and selection should grapple with the facts in detail, and show how the doctrine of the
distinct origin and permanence of species will explain and harmonize them. It has been
recently asserted by a high authority that the difficulty of limiting species is in proportion
to our ignorance, and that just as groups or countries are more accurately known
and studied in greater detail the limits of species become settled<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c007'><sup>[5]</sup></a>. This statement has,
like many other general assertions, its portion of both truth and error. There is no doubt
that many uncertain species, founded on few or isolated specimens, have had their
true nature determined by the study of a good series of examples: they have been
thereby established as species or as varieties; and the number of times this has occurred
is doubtless very great. But there are other and equally trustworthy cases in which, not
single species, but whole groups have, by the study of a vast accumulation of materials,
been proved to have no definite specific limits. A few of these must be adduced. In
Dr. Carpenter‚Äôs ‚ÄòIntroduction to the Study of the Foraminifera,‚Äô he states that ‚Äú<i>there is
not a single specimen of plant or animal of which the range of variation has been studied
by the collocation and comparison of so large a number of specimens as have passed under
the review of Messrs. Williamson, Parker, Rupert Jones, and myself, in our studies of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>types of this group</i>;‚Äù and the result of this extended comparison of specimens is stated to
be, ‚Äú<i>The range of variation is so great among the Foraminifera as to include not merely
those differential characters which have been usually accounted</i> <span class='fss'>SPECIFIC</span>, <i>but also those
upon which the greater part of the</i> <span class='fss'>GENERA</span> <i>of this group have been founded, and even in
some instances those of its</i> <span class='fss'>ORDERS</span>‚Äù (Foraminifera, Preface, x). Yet this same group
had been divided by D‚ÄôOrbigny and other authors into a number of clearly defined <i>families</i>,
<i>genera</i>, and <i>species</i>, which these careful and conscientious researches have shown to have
been almost all founded on incomplete knowledge.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. See Dr. J. E. Gray ‚ÄúOn the Species of Lemuroids,‚Äù Proc. Zool. Soc. 1863, p. 134.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Professor DeCandolle has recently given the results of an extensive review of the species
of <i>Cupulifer√¶</i>. He finds that the best-known species of oaks are those which produce
most varieties and subvarieties, that they are often surrounded by provisional species;
and, with the fullest materials at his command, two-thirds of the species he considers
more or less doubtful. His general conclusion is, that ‚Äú<i>in botany the lowest series of
groups</i>, <span class='fss'>SUBVARIETIES</span>, <span class='fss'>VARIETIES</span>, <i>and</i> <span class='fss'>RACES</span> <i>are very badly limited; these can be grouped
into</i> <span class='fss'>SPECIES</span> <i>a little less vaguely limited, which again can be formed into sufficiently precise</i>
<span class='fss'>GENERA</span>.‚Äù This general conclusion is entirely objected to by the writer of the article in
the ‚ÄòNatural History Review,‚Äô who, however, does not deny its applicability to the particular
order under discussion, while this very difference of opinion is another proof that
difficulties in the determination of species do not, any more than in the higher groups,
vanish with increasing materials and more accurate research.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another striking example of the same kind is seen in the genera <i>Rubus</i> and <i>Rosa</i>,
adduced by Mr. Darwin himself; for though the amplest materials exist for a knowledge
of these groups, and the most careful research has been bestowed upon them, yet the
various species have not thereby been accurately limited and defined so as to satisfy the
majority of botanists.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Hooker seems to have found the same thing in his study of the Arctic flora. For
though he has had much of the accumulated materials of his predecessors to work upon,
he continually expresses himself as unable to do more than group the numerous and
apparently fluctuating forms into more or less imperfectly defined species<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c007'><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. In his paper on the ‚ÄúDistribution of Arctic Plants,‚Äù Trans. Linn. Soc. xxiii. p. 310, Dr. Hooker says:‚Äî</p>

<p class='c008'>‚ÄúThe most able and experienced descriptive botanists vary in their estimate of the value of the ‚Äòspecific term‚Äô to a
much greater extent than is generally supposed.‚Äù</p>

<p class='c009'>‚ÄúI think I may safely affirm that the ‚Äòspecific term‚Äô has three different standard values, all current in descriptive
botany, but each more or less confined to one class of observers.‚Äù</p>

<p class='c009'>‚ÄúThis is no question of what is right or wrong as to the real value of the specific term; I believe each is right
according to the standard he assumes as the specific.‚Äù</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Lastly, I will adduce Mr. Bates‚Äôs researches on the Amazons. During eleven years he
accumulated vast materials, and carefully studied the variation and distribution of insects.
Yet he has shown that many species of Lepidoptera, which before offered no special difficulties,
are in reality most intricately combined in a tangled web of affinities, leading by
such gradual steps from the slightest and least stable variations to fixed races and well-marked
species, that it is very often impossible to draw those sharp dividing-lines which
it is supposed that a careful study and full materials will always enable us to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>These few examples show, I think, that in every department of nature there occur
instances of the instability of specific form, which the increase of materials aggravates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>rather than diminishes. And it must be remembered that the naturalist is rarely likely
to err on the side of imputing greater indefiniteness to species than really exists. There
is a completeness and satisfaction to the mind in defining and limiting and naming a
species, which leads us all to do so whenever we conscientiously can, and which we know
has led many collectors to reject vague intermediate forms as destroying the symmetry of
their cabinets. We must therefore consider these cases of excessive variation and instability
as being thoroughly well established; and to the objection that, after all, these cases
are but few compared with those in which species can be limited and defined, and are
therefore merely exceptions to a general rule, I reply that a true law embraces all
apparent exceptions, and that to the great laws of nature there are no real exceptions‚Äîthat
what appear to be such are equally results of law, and are often (perhaps indeed
always) those very results which are most important as revealing the true nature and
action of the law. It is for such reasons that naturalists now look upon the study of
<i>varieties</i> as more important than that of well-fixed species. It is in the former that we
see nature still at work, in the very act of producing those wonderful modifications of form,
that endless variety of colour, and that complicated harmony of relations, which gratify
every sense and give occupation to every faculty of the true lover of nature.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Variation as specially influenced by Locality.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>The phenomena of variation as influenced by locality have not hitherto received much
attention. Botanists, it is true, are acquainted with the influences of climate, altitude, and
other physical conditions in modifying the forms and external characteristics of plants;
but I am not aware that any peculiar influence has been traced to locality, independent
of climate. Almost the only case I can find recorded is mentioned in that repertory of
natural-history facts, ‚ÄòThe Origin of Species,‚Äô viz. that herbaceous groups have a tendency
to become arboreal in islands. In the animal world, I cannot find that any facts have
been pointed out as showing the special influence of locality in giving a peculiar <i>facies</i>
to the several disconnected species that inhabit it. What I have to adduce on this
matter will therefore, I hope, possess some interest and novelty.</p>

<p class='c006'>On examining the closely allied species, local forms, and varieties distributed over the
Indian and Malayan regions, I find that larger or smaller districts, or even single islands,
give a special character to the majority of their Papilionid√¶. For instance: 1. The
species of the Indian region (Sumatra, Java, and Borneo) are almost invariably smaller
than the allied species inhabiting Celebes and the Moluccas; 2. The species of New
Guinea and Australia are also, though in a less degree, smaller than the nearest species
or varieties of the Moluccas; 3. In the Moluccas themselves the species of Amboyna are
the largest; 4. The species of Celebes equal or even surpass in size those of Amboyna;
5. The species and varieties of Celebes possess a striking character in the form of the
anterior wings, different from that of the allied species and varieties of all the surrounding
islands; 6. Tailed species in India or the Indian region become tailless as they
spread eastward through the archipelago.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having preserved the finest and largest specimens of Butterflies in my own collection,
and having always taken for comparison the largest specimens of the same sex, I believe
that the tables I now give are sufficiently exact. The differences of expanse of wings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>are in most cases very great, and are much more conspicuous in the specimens themselves
than on paper. It will be seen that no less than fourteen Papilionid√¶ inhabiting Celebes
and the Moluccas are from one-third to one-half greater in extent of wing than the allied
species representing them in Java, Sumatra, and Borneo. Six species inhabiting Amboyna
are larger than the closely allied forms of the northern Moluccas and New Guinea by about
one-sixth. These include almost every case in which closely allied species can be compared.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most conspicuous instance of local modification of form, however, is exhibited in
the island of Celebes, which in this respect, as in some others, stands alone and isolated
in the whole archipelago. Almost every species of <i>Papilio</i> inhabiting Celebes has the
wings of a peculiar shape, which distinguishes them at a glance from the allied species of
every other island. This peculiarity consists, first, in the upper wings being generally
more elongate and falcate; and secondly, in the costa or anterior margin being much
more curved, and in most instances exhibiting near the base an abrupt bend or elbow,
which in some species is very conspicuous. This peculiarity is visible, not only when
the Celebesian species are compared with their small-sized allies of Java and Borneo, but
also, and in an almost equal degree, when the large forms of Amboyna and the Moluccas
are the objects of comparison, showing that this is quite a distinct phenomenon from the
difference of size which has just been pointed out.</p>

<p class='c006'>It thus appears that every species of <i>Papilio</i> exhibits this peculiar form in a greater or
less degree, except one, <i>P. Polyphontes</i>, Bd., allied to <i>P. Diphilus</i> of India and <i>P. Polydorus</i>
of the Moluccas. This fact I shall recur to again, as I think it helps us to understand
something of the causes that may have brought about the phenomenon we are considering.
Neither do the genera <i>Ornithoptera</i> and <i>Leptocircus</i> exhibit any traces of this peculiar
form. In several other families of Butterflies this characteristic form reappears in a few
species. In the Pierid√¶ the following species exhibit it distinctly:‚Äî</p>

<p class='c024'>All these belong to the family of the Nymphalid√¶. Many other genera of this family, as
<i>Diadema</i>, <i>Adolias</i>, <i>Charaxes</i>, and <i>Cyrestis</i>, as well as the entire families of the Danaid√¶,
Satyrid√¶, Lyc√¶nid√¶, and Hesperid√¶, present no examples of this peculiar form of the
upper wing in the Celebesian species.</p>

<p class='c005'>The facts now brought forward seem to me of the highest interest. We see that
almost all the species in two important families of the Lepidoptera (Papilionid√¶ and
Pierid√¶) acquire, in a single island, a characteristic modification of form distinguishing
them from the allied species and varieties of all the surrounding islands. In other
equally extensive families no such change occurs, except in one or two isolated species.
However we may account for these phenomena, or whether we may be quite unable to
account for them, they furnish, in my opinion, a strong corroborative testimony in favour
of the doctrine of the origin of species by successive small variations; for we have here
slight varieties, local races, and undoubted species, all modified in exactly the same
manner, indicating plainly a common cause producing identical results. On the generally
received theory of the original distinctness and permanence of species, we are met
by this difficulty: one portion of these curiously modified forms are admitted to have
been produced by variation and some natural action of local conditions; whilst the other
portion, differing from the former only in degree, and connected with them by insensible
gradations, are said to have possessed this peculiarity of form at their first creation, or to
have derived it from unknown causes of a totally distinct nature. Is not the <i>√† priori</i>
evidence in favour of the assumption of an identity of the causes that have produced
such similar results? and have we not a right to call upon our opponents for some proofs
of their own doctrine, and for an explanation of its difficulties, instead of their assuming
that they are right, and laying upon us the burthen of disproof?</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us now see if the facts in question do not themselves furnish some clue to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>own explanation. Mr. Bates has shown that certain groups of butterflies have a defence
against insectivorous animals, independent of swiftness of motion. These are generally
very abundant, slow, and weak fliers, and are more or less the objects of mimicry by
other groups, which thus gain an advantage in a freedom from persecution similar to
that enjoyed by those they resemble. Now the only Papilios which have not in Celebes
acquired the peculiar form of wing belong to a group which is imitated both by other
species of <i>Papilio</i> and by Moths of the genus <i>Epicopeia</i>, West. This group is of weak
and slow flight; and we may therefore fairly conclude that it possesses some means of
defence (probably in a peculiar odour or taste) which saves it from attack. Now the
arched costa and falcate form of wing is generally supposed to give increased powers of
flight, or, as seems to me more probable, greater facility in making sudden turnings, and
thus baffling a pursuer. But the members of the <i>Polydorus</i>-group (to which belongs the
only unchanged Celebesian <i>Papilio</i>), being already guarded against attack, have no need
of this increased power of wing; and ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù would therefore have no tendency
to produce it. The whole family of Danaid√¶ are in the same position: they are slow and
weak fliers; yet they abound in species and individuals, and are the objects of mimicry.
The Satyrid√¶ have also probably a means of protection‚Äîperhaps their keeping always
near the ground and their generally obscure colours; while the Lyc√¶nid√¶ and Hesperid√¶
may find security in their small size and rapid motions. In the extensive family of the
Nymphalid√¶, however, we find that several of the larger species, of comparatively feeble
structure, have their wings modified (<i>Cethosia</i>, <i>Limenitis</i>, <i>Junonia</i>, <i>Cynthia</i>), while the
large-bodied powerful species, which have all an excessively rapid flight, have exactly
the same form of wing in Celebes as in the other islands. On the whole, therefore, we
may say that all the butterflies of rather large size, conspicuous colours, and not very
swift flight have been affected in the manner described, while the smaller-sized and
obscure groups, as well as those which are the objects of mimicry, and also those of
exceedingly swift flight, have remained unaffected.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would thus appear as if there must be (or once have been) in the island of
Celebes, some peculiar enemy to these larger-sized butterflies which does not exist, or is
less abundant, in the surrounding islands. Increased powers of flight, or rapidity of
turning, was advantageous in baffling this enemy; and the peculiar form of wing necessary
to give this would be readily acquired by the action of ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù on the slight
variations of form that are continually occurring. Such an enemy one would naturally
suppose to be an insectivorous bird; but it is a remarkable fact that most of the genera
of Fly-catchers of Borneo and Java on the one side (<i>Muscipeta</i>, <i>Philentoma</i>), and of the
Moluccas on the other (<i>Monarcha</i>, <i>Rhipidura</i>), are almost entirely absent from Celebes.
Their place seems to be supplied by the Caterpillar-catchers (<i>Graucalus</i>, <i>Campephaga</i>), of
which six or seven species are known from Celebes and are very numerous in individuals.
We have no positive evidence that these birds pursue butterflies on the wing, but it is
highly probable that they do so when other food is scarce<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c007'><sup>[7]</sup></a>. However this may be, the
fauna of Celebes is undoubtedly highly peculiar in every department of which we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>any knowledge; and though we may not be able to trace it satisfactorily, there can, I
think, be little doubt that the singular modification in the wings of so many of the
butterflies of that island is an effect of that complicated action and reaction of all living
things upon each other in the struggle for existence, which continually tends to readjust
disturbed relations, and to bring every species into harmony with the varying conditions
of the surrounding universe.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. Mr. Bates has suggested that the larger Dragon-flies (<i>√Üshna</i>, &#38;c.) prey upon butterflies; but I did not notice that
they were more abundant in Celebes than elsewhere.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But even the conjectural explanation now given fails us in the other cases of local modification.
Why the species of the western islands should be smaller than those further east,‚Äîwhy
those of Amboyna should exceed in size those of Gilolo and New Guinea‚Äîwhy
the tailed species of India should begin to lose that appendage in the islands, and retain
no trace of it on the borders of the Pacific, are questions which we cannot at present
attempt to answer. That they depend, however, on some general principle is certain,
because analogous facts have been observed in other parts of the world. Mr. Bates
informs me that, in three distinct groups, Papilios which on the Upper Amazon and in
most other parts of South America have spotless upper wings obtain pale or white spots
at Para and on the Lower Amazon; and also that the <i>√Üneas</i>-group of Papilios never have
tails in the equatorial regions and the Amazons valley, but gradually acquire tails in many
cases as they range towards the northern or southern tropic. Even in Europe we have
somewhat similar facts; for the species and varieties of butterflies peculiar to the island
of Sardinia are generally smaller and more deeply coloured than those of the mainland,
and <i>Papilio Hospiton</i> has lost the tail, which is a prominent feature of the closely allied
<i>P. Machaon</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Facts of a similar nature to those now brought forward would no doubt be found to
occur in other groups of insects, were local faunas carefully studied in relation to those
of the surrounding countries; and they seem to indicate that climate and other physical
causes have, in some cases, a very powerful effect in modifying specific form, and thus
directly aid in producing the endless variety of nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>I may state that I can adduce facts perfectly analogous to these from other families of
Lepidoptera, especially the Danaid√¶; but as the greater part of the species are still undescribed,
I can only now assert that similar phenomena do occur there.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Mimicry.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>I need scarcely say that I entirely agree with Mr. Bates‚Äôs explanation of the
causes which have led to one group of insects mimicking another (Trans. Linn. Soc.
vol. xxiii. p. 495). I have, therefore, only now to adduce such illustrations of this
curious phenomenon as are furnished by the Eastern Papilionid√¶, and to show their
hearing upon the phenomena of variation already mentioned. As in America, so in the
Old World, species of Danaid√¶ are the objects which the other families most often
imitate. But, besides these, some genera of Morphid√¶ and one section of the genus
<i>Papilio</i> are also less frequently copied. Many species of <i>Papilio</i> mimic other species
of these three groups so closely that they are undistinguishable when on the wing; and
in every case the pairs which resemble each other inhabit the same locality.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following list exhibits the most important and best-marked cases of mimicry which
occur among the Papilionid√¶ of the Malayan region and India:‚Äî</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. The terms ‚Äú<i>mimicry</i>‚Äù and ‚Äú<i>mimickers</i>‚Äù have been objected to on the ground that they imply <i>voluntary action</i>
on the part of the insects. This appears to me of little importance compared with the advantages of convenience,
flexibility, and expressiveness which they undoubtedly possess, especially as the whole theory propounded by the
originator of the term in this sense excludes all idea of voluntary action. The only approximately synonymous words,
not implying will, are <i>resemblance</i>, <i>similarity</i>, and <i>likeness</i>; and it is evident that none of these can be applied intelligibly
under the variety of forms required, and to which Mr. Bates‚Äôs expression so readily lends itself in the terms
<i>mimic</i>, <i>mimickers</i>, <i>mimicry</i>, <i>mimicked</i>. Add to this the inconvenience of changing a term which, from the interest
and wide discussion of the subject, must be already very generally understood, and I think it will be admitted that
nothing would be gained by altering it, even if a better word were pointed out, which has not yet been done.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We have therefore fifteen species or marked varieties of <i>Papilio</i> which so closely
resemble species of other groups in their respective localities, that it is not possible to
impute the resemblance to accident. The first two in the list (<i>Papilio paradoxa</i> and <i>P.
Caunus</i>) are so exactly like <i>Eupl≈ìa Midamus</i> and <i>E. Rhadamanthus</i> on the wing, that,
although they fly very slowly, I was quite unable to distinguish them. The first is a
very interesting case, because the male and female differ considerably, and each mimics
the corresponding sex of the <i>Eupl≈ìa</i>. A new species of <i>Papilio</i> which I discovered in
New Guinea resembles <i>Danais sobrina</i>, Bd., from the same country, just as <i>Papilio
Macareus</i> resembles <i>Danais Aglaia</i> in Malacca, and (according to Dr. Horsfield‚Äôs figure)
still more closely in Java. The Indian <i>Papilio Agestor</i> closely imitates <i>Danais Tytia</i>,
which has quite a different style of colouring from the preceding; and the extraordinary
<i>Papilio id√¶oides</i> from the Philippine Islands must, when on the wing, perfectly resemble
the <i>Hestia Leucono√´</i> of the same region, as also does the <i>P. Delessertii</i>, Gu√©r., imitate an
undescribed species of <i>Hestia</i> from Penang. Now in every one of these cases the Papilios
are very scarce, while the Danaid√¶ which they resemble are exceedingly abundant‚Äîmost
of them swarming so as to be a positive nuisance to the collecting entomologist by continually
hovering before him when he is in search of newer and more varied captures.
Every garden, every roadside, the suburbs of every village are full of them, indicating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>very clearly that their life is an easy one, and that they are free from persecution by the
foes which keep down the population of less favoured races. This superabundant population
has been shown by Mr. Bates to be a general characteristic of all American groups
and species which are objects of mimicry; and it is interesting to find his observations
confirmed by examples on the other side of the globe.</p>

<p class='c006'>The remarkable genus <i>Drusilla</i>, a group of pale-coloured butterflies, more or less
adorned with ocellate spots, is also the object of mimicry by three distinct genera
(<i>Melanitis</i>, <i>Hyantis</i>, and <i>Papilio</i>). These insects, like the <i>Danaid√¶</i>, are abundant
in individuals, have a very weak and slow flight, and do not seek concealment, or
appear to have any means of protection from insectivorous creatures. It is natural to
conclude, therefore, that they have some hidden property which saves them from attack;
and it is easy to see that when any other insects, by what we call accidental variation,
come more or less remotely to resemble them, the latter will share to some extent in
their immunity. An extraordinary dimorphic form of a female <i>Papilio</i> has come to
resemble the Drusillas sufficiently to be taken for one of that group at a little distance;
and it is curious that I captured one of these Papilios in the Aru Islands hovering along
the ground, and settling on it occasionally, just as it is the habit of the Drusillas to do.
The resemblance in this case is only general; but this form of <i>Papilio</i> varies much, and
there is therefore material for natural selection to act upon so as ultimately to produce
a copy as exact as in the other cases.</p>

<p class='c006'>The eastern Papilios allied to <i>Polydorus Coon</i> and <i>P. Philoxenus</i>, form a natural section
of the genus resembling, in many respects, the <i>√Üneas</i>-group of South America, which
they may be said to represent in the East. Like them, they are forest insects, have a
low and weak flight, and in their favourite localities are rather abundant in individuals;
and like them, too, they are the objects of mimicry. We may conclude, therefore, that
they possess some hidden means of protection, which makes it useful to other insects to
be mistaken for them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Papilios which resemble them belong to a very distinct section of the genus, in
which the sexes differ greatly; and it is those females only which differ most from
the males, and which have already been alluded to as exhibiting instances of dimorphism,
which resemble species of the other group.</p>

<p class='c006'>The resemblance of <i>P. Romulus</i> to <i>P. Hector</i> is, in some specimens, very considerable,
and has led to the two species being placed to follow each other in the British Museum Catalogues
and by Mr. E. Doubleday. I have shown, however, that <i>P. Romulus</i> is probably a
dimorphic form of the female <i>P. Pammon</i>, and belongs to a distinct section of the genus<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c007'><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. See Plate II. fig. 6.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The next pair, <i>P. Theseus</i>, Cr., and <i>P. Antiphus</i>, Fab., have been united as one species
both by De Haan and in the British Museum Catalogues. The ordinary variety of <i>P.
Theseus</i> found in Java almost as nearly resembles <i>P. Diphilus</i>, Esp., of the same country.
The most interesting case, however, is the extreme female form of <i>P. Memnon</i> (<i>P. Achates</i>,
Cr.)<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c007'><sup>[10]</sup></a>, which has acquired the general form and markings of <i>P. Coon</i>, an insect which differs
from the ordinary male <i>P. Memnon</i>, as much as any two species differ which can be chosen
in this extensive and highly varied genus; and, as if to show that this resemblance is not
accidental, but is the result of law, when in India we find a species closely allied to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span><i>P. Coon</i>, but with red instead of yellow spots (<i>P. Doubledayi</i>, Wall.), the corresponding
variety of <i>P. Androgeus</i> (<i>P. Achates</i>, Cram., 182, <span class='fss'>A</span>, <span class='fss'>B</span>,) has acquired exactly the same
peculiarity of having red spots instead of yellow. Lastly, in the island of Timor, the
female of <i>P. ≈ínomaus</i> (a species allied to <i>P. Memnon</i>) resembles so closely <i>P. Liris</i>
(one of the <i>Polydorus</i>-group), that the two, which were often seen flying together, could
only be distinguished by a minute comparison after being captured.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last six cases of mimicry are especially instructive, because they seem to indicate
one of the processes by which dimorphic forms have been produced. When, as in these
cases, one sex differs much from the other, and varies greatly itself, it may happen that
occasionally individual variations will occur having a distant resemblance to groups which
are the objects of mimicry, and which it is therefore advantageous to resemble. Such
a variety will have a better chance of preservation; the individuals possessing it will be
multiplied; and their accidental likeness to the favoured group will be rendered permanent
by hereditary transmission, and, each successive variation which increases the resemblance
being preserved, and all variations departing from the favoured type having
less chance of preservation, there will in time result those singular cases of two or more
isolated and fixed forms bound together by that intimate relationship which constitutes
them the sexes of a single species. The reason why the females are more subject to this
kind of modification than the males is, probably, that their slower flight, when laden
with eggs, and their exposure to attack while in the act of depositing their eggs upon
leaves, render it especially advantageous for them to have some additional protection.
This they at once obtain by acquiring a resemblance to other species which, from whatever
cause, enjoy a comparative immunity from persecution.</p>

<p class='c006'>This summary of the more interesting phenomena of variation presented by the eastern
Papilionid√¶ is, I think, sufficient to substantiate my position, that the Lepidoptera are
a group that offer especial facilities for such inquiries; and it will also show that they
have undergone an amount of special adaptive modification rarely equalled among
the more highly organized animals. And, among the Lepidoptera, the great and pre-eminently
tropical families of Papilionid√¶ and Danaid√¶ seem to be those in which complicated
adaptations to the surrounding organic and inorganic universe have been most
completely developed, offering in this respect a striking analogy to the equally extraordinary,
though totally different, adaptations which present themselves in the <i>Orchide√¶</i>,
the only family of plants in which mimicry of other organisms appears to play any important
part, and the only one in which striking cases of polymorphism occur; for such
we must consider to be the male, female, and hermaphrodite forms of <i>Catasetum tridentatum</i>,
which differ so greatly in form and structure that they were long considered
to belong to three distinct genera.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Arrangement and Geographical Distribution of the Malayan</i> Papilionid√¶.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Although the species of Papilionid√¶ inhabiting the Malayan region are very numerous,
they all belong to three out of the nine genera into which the family is divided. One of
the remaining genera (<i>Eurycus</i>) is restricted to Australia, and another (<i>Teinopalpus</i>) to the
Himalayan Mountains, while no less than four (<i>Parnassius</i>, <i>Doritis</i>, <i>Thais</i>, and <i>Sericinus</i>)
are confined to Southern Europe and to the mountain-ranges of the Pal√¶arctic region.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>The genera <i>Ornithoptera</i> and <i>Leptocircus</i> are highly characteristic of Malayan entomology,
but are uniform in character and of small extent. The genus <i>Papilio</i>, on the other
hand, presents a great variety of forms, and is so richly represented in the Malay islands,
that more than one-fourth of all the known species are found there. It becomes necessary,
therefore, to divide this genus into natural groups before we can successfully
study its geographical distribution.</p>

<p class='c006'>Owing principally to Dr. Horsfield‚Äôs observations in Java, we are acquainted with a
considerable number of the larv√¶ of Papilios; and these furnish good characters for the
primary division of the genus into natural groups. The manner in which the hinder
wings are plaited or folded back at the abdominal margin, the size of the anal valves, the
structure of the antenn√¶, and the form of the wings are also of much service, as well
as the character of the flight and the style of coloration. Using these characters, I
divide the Malayan Papilios into four sections, and seventeen groups, as follows:‚Äî</p>

<p class='c028'>Genus <span class='sc'>Leptocircus</span>.</p>

<p class='c024'>making, in all, twenty distinct groups of Malayan Papilionid√¶.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first section of the genus <i>Papilio</i> (A) comprises insects which, though differing
considerably in structure, have much general resemblance. They all have a weak, low
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>flight, frequent the most luxuriant forest districts, seem to love the shade, and are the
objects of mimicry by other Papilios.</p>

<p class='c006'>Section B consists of weak-bodied, large-winged insects, with an irregular wavering
flight, and which, when resting on foliage, often expand the wings, which the species
of the other sections rarely or never do. They are the most conspicuous and striking
of eastern Butterflies.</p>

<p class='c006'>Section C consists of much weaker and slower-flying insects, often resembling in their
flight, as well as in their colours, species of Danaid√¶.</p>

<p class='c006'>Section D contains the strongest-bodied and most swift-flying of the genus. They
love sunlight, and frequent the borders of streams and the edges of puddles, where
they gather together in swarms consisting of several species, greedily sucking up the
moisture, and, when disturbed, circling round in the air, or flying high and with great
strength and rapidity.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the following Table I have arranged all the Malayan Papilionid√¶ in what appears
to me their most natural succession, and have exhibited their distribution in twenty-one
columns of localities, extending from the Malay peninsula, on the north-west, to Woodlark
Island, near New Guinea, on the south-east. The double line divides the Indo-Malayan
from the Austro-Malayan region; and those islands which form natural zoological groups
are connected by brackets.</p>

<p class='c006'>The exceeding richness of the Malayan region in these fine insects is seen by comparing
the number of species found in the different tropical regions of the earth. From
all Africa only 33 species of <i>Papilio</i> are known; but as several are still undescribed
in collections, we may raise their number to about 40. In all tropical Asia there are at
present described only 65 species, and I have seen in collections but two or three which
have not yet been named. In South America, south of Panama, there are 120 species,
or about the same number as I make in the Malayan region; but the area of the two
countries is very different; for while South America (even excluding Patagonia) contains
5,000,000 square miles, a line encircling the whole of the Malayan islands would only
include an area of 2,700,000 square miles, of which the land-area would be about
1,000,000 square miles. This superior richness is partly real and partly apparent. The
breaking up of a district into small isolated portions, as in an archipelago, seems highly
favourable to the segregation and perpetuation of local peculiarities in certain groups; so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>that a species which on a continent might have a wide range, and whose local forms, if
any, would be so connected together that it would be impossible to separate them, may
become by isolation reduced to a number of such clearly defined and constant forms that
we are obliged to count them as species. From this point of view, therefore, the superior
number of Malayan species may be considered as apparent only. Its true superiority is
shown, on the other hand, by the possession of three genera and twenty groups of Papilionid√¶
against a single genus and eight groups in South America, and also by the
much greater average size of the Malayan species. In most other families, however, the
reverse is the case, the South American <i>Nymphalid√¶</i>, <i>Satyrid√¶</i>, and <i>Erycinid√¶</i> far surpassing
those of the East in number, variety, and beauty.</p>

three out of the nineteen groups ranging beyond, into Africa, Europe, or America. The
limitation of groups to the Indo-Malayan or Austro-Malayan divisions of the archipelago,
which is so well marked in the higher animals (see ‚ÄòJournal of Linnean Society,‚Äô

<p class='c006'>The remaining groups, which range over the whole archipelago, are, in many cases,
insects of very powerful flight, or they frequent open places and the sea-beach, and are
thus more likely to get blown from island to island. The fact that three such characteristic
groups as those of <i>Priamus</i>, <i>Ulysses</i>, and <i>Erechtheus</i> are strictly limited to the
Australian region of the archipelago, while five other groups are with equal strictness
confined to the Indian region, is a strong corroboration of that division which has been
founded almost entirely on the distribution of Mammalia and Birds.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the various Malayan islands have undergone recent changes of level, and if any of
them have been more closely united within the period of existing species than they are
now, we may expect to find indications of such changes in community of species between
islands now widely separated; while those islands which have long remained isolated would
have had time to acquire peculiar forms by a slow and natural process of modification.</p>

<p class='c006'>An examination of the relations of the species of the adjacent islands will thus enable
us to correct opinions formed from a mere consideration of their relative positions. For
example, looking at a map of the archipelago, it is almost impossible to avoid the idea
that Java and Sumatra have been recently united; their present proximity is so great, and
they have such an obvious resemblance in their volcanic structure. Yet there can be
little doubt that this opinion is erroneous, and that Sumatra has had a more recent and
more intimate connexion with Borneo than it has had with Java. This is strikingly shown
by the mammals of these islands‚Äîvery few of the species of Java and Sumatra being
identical, while a considerable number are common to Sumatra and Borneo. The birds
show a somewhat similar relationship; and we shall find that the group of insects we are
now treating of tells exactly the same tale. Thus:‚Äî</p>

<p class='c032'>showing that both Sumatra and Java have a much closer relationship to Borneo than
they have each other‚Äîa most singular and interesting result when we consider the wide
separation of Borneo from them both, and its very different structure. The evidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>furnished by a single group of insects would have had but little weight on a point of such
magnitude if standing alone; but coming as it does to confirm deductions drawn from
whole classes of the higher animals, it must be admitted to have considerable value.</p>

<p class='c006'>We may determine in a similar manner the relations of the different Papuan Islands to
New Guinea. Of thirteen species of Papilionid√¶ obtained in the Aru Islands, five were also
found in New Guinea, and eight not. Of nine species obtained at Waigiou, five were New
Guinea, and four not. The five species found at Mysol were all New Guinea species.
Mysol, therefore, has closer relations to New Guinea than the other islands; and this is
corroborated by the distribution of the birds, of which I will only now give one instance.
The Paradise Bird found in Mysol is the common New Guinea species, while the Aru
Islands and Waigiou have each a species peculiar to themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>The large island of Borneo, which contains more species of Papilionid√¶ than any other
in the archipelago, has nevertheless only two peculiar to itself; and it is quite possible,
and even probable, that one of these may be found in Sumatra or Java. The last-named
island has also two species peculiar to it; Sumatra has not one, and the peninsula of
Malacca only one. The identity of species is even greater than in birds or in most other
groups of insects, and points very strongly to a recent connexion of the whole with each
other and the continent. But when we pass to the next island (Celebes), separated from
them by a strait not wider than that which divides them from each other, we have a striking
contrast; for with a total number of species less than either Borneo or Java, no less
than eighteen are absolutely restricted to it. Further east, the large islands of Ceram
and New Guinea have only three species peculiar to each, and Timor has five. We shall
have to look, not to single islands, but to whole groups, in order to obtain an amount of
individuality comparable with that of Celebes. For example, the extensive group comprising
the large islands of Java, Borneo, and Sumatra, with the peninsula of Malacca,
possessing altogether 45 species, has about 21, or less than half, peculiar to it; the numerous
group of the Philippines possess 21 species, of which 16 are peculiar; the seven
chief islands of the Moluccas have 27, of which 12 are peculiar; and the whole of the
Papuan Islands, with an equal number of species, have 17 peculiar. Comparable with
the most isolated of these groups is Celebes, with its 24 species, of which the large proportion
of 18 are peculiar. We see, therefore, that the opinion I have already expressed,
in the papers before quoted, of the high degree of isolation and the remarkable distinctive
features of this interesting island, is fully borne out by the examination of this conspicuous
family of insects. A single straggling island, with a few small satellites, it is
zoologically of equal importance with extensive groups of islands many times as large as
itself; and standing in the very centre of the archipelago, surrounded on every side with
islets connecting it with the larger groups, and which seem to afford the greatest facilities
for the migration and intercommunication of their respective productions, it yet stands
out conspicuous with a character of its own in every department of nature, and presents
peculiarities which are, I believe, without a parallel in any similar locality on the globe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Briefly to summarize these peculiarities, Celebes possesses three genera of mammals
(out of the very small number which inhabit it) which are of singular and isolated
forms, viz., <i>Cynopithecus</i>, a tailless Ape allied to the Baboons; <i>Anoa</i>, a straight-horned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Antelope of obscure affinities, but quite unlike anything else in the whole archipelago or
in India; and <i>Babirusa</i>, an altogether abnormal wild Pig. With a rather limited bird
population, Celebes has an immense preponderance of species confined to it, and has also
five remarkable genera (<i>Meropogon</i>, <i>Streptocitta</i>, <i>Enodes</i>, <i>Scissirostrum</i>, and <i>Megacephalon</i>)
entirely restricted to its narrow limits, as well as two others (<i>Prioniturus</i> and <i>Basilornis</i>)
which only range to a single island beyond it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Smith‚Äôs elaborate tables of the distribution of Malayan Hymenoptera (see ‚ÄòProc.
Linn. Soc.‚Äô Zool. vol. vii.) show that, out of the large number of 301 species collected in
Celebes, 190 (or nearly two-thirds) were absolutely restricted to it, although Borneo, on
one side, and the various islands of the Moluccas on the other, were equally well explored
by me; and no less than twelve of the genera are not found in any other island of
the archipelago. I have just shown in the present paper that, in the Papilionid√¶, it has
far more species of its own than any other island, and a greater proportion of peculiar
species than many of the large groups of islands in the archipelago‚Äîand that it gives to
a large number of the species and varieties which inhabit it, 1st, an increase of size,
and, 2nd, a peculiar modification in the form of the wings, which stamp upon the most
dissimilar insects a mark distinctive of their common birth-place.</p>

<p class='c006'>What, I would ask, are we to do with phenomena such as these? Are we to rest
content with that very simple, but at the same time very unsatisfying explanation, that
all these insects and other animals were created exactly <i>as</i> they are, and originally placed
exactly <i>where</i> they are, by the inscrutable will of their Creator, and that we have nothing
to do but to register the facts and wonder? Was this single island selected for a fantastic
display of creative power, merely to excite a child-like and unreasoning admiration?
Is all this appearance of gradual modification by the action of natural causes‚Äîa
modification the successive steps of which we can almost trace‚Äîall delusive? Is this
harmony between the most diverse groups, all presenting analogous phenomena, and
indicating a dependence upon physical changes of which we have independent evidence,
all false testimony? If I could think so, the study of nature would have lost for
me its greatest charm. I should feel as would the geologist, if you could convince him
that his interpretation of the earth‚Äôs past history was all a delusion‚Äîthat strata were
never formed in the primeval ocean, and that the fossils he so carefully collects and
studies are no true record of a former living world, but were all created just as they
now are, and in the rocks where he now finds them.</p>

<p class='c006'>I must here express my own belief that none of these phenomena, however apparently
isolated pr insignificant, can ever stand alone‚Äîthat not the wing of a butterfly can
change in form, or vary in colour, except in harmony with, and as a part of, the grand
march of nature. I believe, therefore, that all the curious phenomena I have just recapitulated
are immediately dependent on the last series of changes, organic and inorganic,
in these regions; and as the phenomena presented by the island of Celebes differ
from those of all the surrounding islands, it can, I conceive, only be because the past
history of Celebes has been to some extent unique and different from theirs. We must
have much more evidence to determine exactly in what that difference has consisted.
At present, I only see my way clear to one deduction, viz., that Celebes represents one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>of the oldest parts of the archipelago, that it has been formerly more completely isolated
both from India and from Australia than it is now, and that, amid all the mutations it
has undergone, a relic or substratum of the fauna and flora of some more ancient land
has been here preserved to us.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is only since my return home, and since I have been able to compare the productions
of Celebes side by side with those of the surrounding islands, that I have been fully impressed
with their peculiarity, and the great interest that attaches to them. The plants
and the reptiles are still almost unknown; and it is to be hoped that some enterprising
naturalist may soon devote himself to their study. The geology of the country would
also be well worth exploring, and its recent fossils would be of especial interest as elucidating
the changes which have led to its present anomalous condition. This island
stands, as it were, upon the boundary-line between two worlds. On one side is that
ancient Australian fauna which preserves to the present day the facies of an early geological
epoch; on the other is the rich and varied fauna of Asia, which seems to contain,
in every class and order, the most perfect and highly organized animals. Celebes has
relations to both, yet strictly belongs to neither; it possesses characteristics which are
altogether its own; and I am convinced that no single island upon the globe would so
well repay a careful and detailed research into its past and present history.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the following catalogue of the Malayan species of Papilionid√¶ I have included those
from Woodlark Island, collected by M. Montrouzier, as that island comes fairly within
the limits of the archipelago; while I exclude New Caledonia as belonging more to the
Australian and Pacific fauna. I have given full particulars of the variation of the
several species, and have described all new species, forms, varieties, and undescribed
sexes. The distribution of each species is noted chiefly from my own observations<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c007'><sup>[11]</sup></a>. As
the full synonymy and references to almost every work on Lepidoptera are given in the
British Museum List of Papilionid√¶, I have not thought it necessary to do more than
to refer to a good figure and description in well-known works; and I have quoted Boisduval‚Äôs
‚ÄòSpecies G√©n√©ral des L√©pidopt√®res‚Äô throughout. In all cases, however, where I
have myself corrected the synonymy, or determined sexes which had been before improperly
located, I have given much fuller references.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. Species collected by myself have (Wall.) after the localities where I have found them.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I have found it necessary to describe and name twenty new species, and to separate
six or seven more which have been hitherto considered as varieties or sexes of other
species. I have also described and separated twenty-five local forms or races, and
twenty polymorphous forms or sexes, as well as several simple varieties. On the other
hand, I have reduced fourteen species, which figure in some of our latest lists, to the
rank of sexes or local or polymorphic forms of other species. For convenience of reference,
I add a list of these, with a reference to the page where will be found the reasons for
not adopting them.</p>

<p>Fig. 1.<br>  <br>  Anal valves of <i>O. Amphrisius</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The characters in the <i>larva</i> and <i>pupa</i> which have been supposed to distinguish this
genus from <span class='sc'>Papilio</span> are erroneous, or at least do not exist in all the species. My own
observations on <i>O. Poseidon</i> show that the <i>larva</i> has no ‚Äúexternal sheath‚Äù to the thoracic
tentacles, and that the suspending thread passes round the pupa, and is not ‚Äúfastened
on each side to a silky tubercle.‚Äù There remain therefore only the characters of
the perfect insect, the most important of which are the anal valves in the male. These
are very large, ovate or rounded, coriaceous, and not hairy, and are furnished with projecting
points or spines (sometimes very conspicuous) which serve
to attach the male more firmly to the female <i>in copul√¢</i>. In
several species I have observed, these points or hooks were buried
in the protruded anal gland of the female, and thus effectually prevented
the great weight of the insects causing them to separate upon
suddenly taking flight. The great strength and size of these insects,
the thick texture of their wings, their long curved and stout antenn√¶,
their peculiar form, colour, and distribution, are the only other characters that
separate them from <i>Papilio</i>. Though these may not perhaps be technically sufficient, I
think it advisable and convenient to retain a genus so well known and long established.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Ornithoptera</i> is pre-eminently a Malayan genus, seventeen species inhabiting the archipelago,
one (<i>Rhadamanthus</i>, Bd.) India and China, one (<i>Darsius</i>, G. R. Gray) peculiar
to Ceylon, one (<i>Richmondia</i>, G. R. Gray) North Australia. <i>O. Victori√¶</i>, G. R. Gray,
from some island east of New Guinea, should probably be included in the Malayan list;
and <i>√Üacus</i>, Felder, from an unknown locality. The following are the well-established
Malayan species.</p>

<p class='c006'>This may be at once distinguished from all the allied species with which it has been
often confounded‚Äîin the <i>male</i>, by the more rounded and deeply scalloped hind wings,
with larger black spots and a broader border, the upper wings with no green on the
median nervure or its branches, and the sooty patch extending only to the second median
nervule; in the <i>female</i>, by the very constant and peculiar light olive-brown colour, the
absence of any spots in the discoidal cell of the upper wings, and the broad shallow scallops
of the hinder margin.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>The numerous specimens of <i>Ornithoptera</i> which I obtained in various parts of New
Guinea and the adjacent islands show so much instability of form, colouring, and even of
neuration, no two individuals being exactly alike, that I am obliged to include them all
in one variable species, to which I believe must also be referred <i>O. Pronomus</i>, G. R.
Gray, from Cape York, <i>O. Euphorion</i>, G. R. Gray, from North Australia, <i>O. Archideus</i>,
G. R. Gray (ex Boisd.), erroneously said to be from Celebes, and <i>O. Boisduvalii</i>, Montrouzier,
from Woodlark Island.</p>

<p class='c024'>Var. <i>a</i>, Aru Islands (<i>Wall.</i>). <i>O. Arruana</i>, Feld. Lep. Frag. p. 24.</p>

<p class='c006'>Individuals from this locality differ in the arrangement of the nervures; in some the
third subcostal nervure of the upper wings branches from the same point with the upper
disco-cellular, in others considerably beyond it; the points from which the subcostal nervures
branch also vary. The amount of green colour on the median nervure and its
branches varies. In some specimens there is a spot at the anal angle of lower wings beneath,
agreeing with <i>O. Pronomus</i>, G. R. Gray; but this is generally wanting.</p>

<p class='c024'>Var. <i>b</i>, Dorey, Salwatty, south-west coast of New Guinea (<i>Wall.</i>).</p>

<p class='c006'>These agree very closely with <i>O. Poseidon</i>, as figured by Westwood; they differ individually
in the same manner as the last, and also in the length of the lower disco-cellular nervure
on the under wings. They have generally no golden spots beneath the wings. They
vary also in the outline of the under wings, the outer and anal angles being more acute
in some specimens than in others. Some have the under wings of a uniform green entirely
without spots, while others have a range of black spots more or less fully developed.</p>

<p class='c024'>Var. <i>c</i>, Waigiou (<i>Wall.</i>). <i>Archideus</i>, G. R. Gray, ‚ôÄ.</p>

<p class='c006'>This agrees with the last; but the male is of a more delicate green than any of the
others, and has less of that colour on the median veins. On the under side there are no
golden spots. The whole surface has a golden tinge, and the central portion of the lower
wings is tinged with amber-brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>The females of all the above vary extremely, much more even than the males, and from
the same locality two specimens are rarely alike. The discoidal cell is in some specimens
more than half occupied by a whitish patch, while in others there are only a few small
spots. One of my specimens from Salwatty almost exactly agrees with that figured by
Westwood (Cat. of Or. Ent. pl. 14) as from Cape York. One of the Waigiou specimens is
the same as <i>Archideus</i>, G. R. G., figured by Boisduval (Voy. de l‚ÄôAstrolabe, t. 4. f. 1, 2);
and another, from New Guinea, differs very little from <i>Euphorion</i>, G. R. G. (Brit. Mus.
Cat. Lep. pt. 1. pl. 2. f. 3), from North Australia.</p>

<p class='c006'>From these facts I am led to conclude that we have here a variable form spread over
an extensive area, and kept variable by the continual intercrossing of individuals, which
would otherwise segregate into distinct and sharply defined races. The same area is
inhabited by many species of birds common to all parts of it; and just as the birds of
Ceram and Amboyna are almost all distinct species from those of New Guinea, so do we
find those islands inhabited by the <i>Ornithoptera Priamus</i>, a well-marked and constant
species, readily distinguishable in either sex from the inconstant forms of New Guinea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>proper. The same parallel holds in North Australia. Many New Guinea species of
birds extend, with very slight variation, to the country about Cape York; but when we
reach the Moreton Bay district all these have disappeared, and we find only true Australian
species. So the variable forms of <i>O. Poseidon</i> reach North Australia and Cape York,
while in the Moreton Bay district we find the comparatively well-marked species <i>O. Richmondia</i>.
Similar causes, whether geographical or climatal, have thus produced an analogous
distribution in these widely separated groups of animals.</p>

<p class='c034'><i>Hab.</i> Batchian (Moluccas) (<i>Wall.</i>).</p>

<p class='c006'>Local form, <i>a.</i>‚Äî<i>Male</i>: has the orange colour of the upper surface of a much deeper
fiery-red hue; on the under surface, the black spots of the lower wings are nearer the
margin, and the yellow spots below them are entirely absent; there is also a green line
between the subcostal nervure and the margin; on the under surface of the fore wings
the green patch in the discoidal cell extends to its base, and is reflexed in a narrow line
along its upper edge.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Female</i>: differs still more from that sex in <i>O. Cr≈ìsus</i>; the white markings on all the
wings are so large as almost to fill up the spaces between the veins, the lower part of the
discoidal cell in both upper and under wings being also occupied with a whitish patch;
the range of spots occupying the posterior margin are of a dusky yellow colour.</p>

<p class='c034'><i>Hab.</i> Ternate (‚ôÇ), Gilolo (‚ôÄ) (<i>Wall.</i>).</p>

<p class='c006'>This well-marked local form is no doubt peculiar to Gilolo and the small adjacent
islands, as the original species is to Batchian.</p>

<p class='c006'>I was three months in the island of Batchian before I obtained a specimen of this fine
insect, which I had seen once or twice only flying high in the air. I at length came
upon it flying about a beautiful cinchonaceous shrub with white bracts and yellow
flowers (<i>Muss√¶nda</i>, sp.); and having cleared a path round about, I visited the place every
morning on my way to the forest, and once or twice a week had the satisfaction of capturing
a fine male specimen of <i>O. Cr≈ìsus</i>. The females were more plentiful and more
easily caught. I afterwards sent out one of my men with a net every day to look after
this insect only. He would stay out all day long, wandering up a broad rocky torrent,
where the males flew up and down occasionally or settled on the rocks which just appeared
above the water. He generally brought me one, and sometimes even two or
three specimens; and thus, with those that I myself captured at the flowers, I secured
a fine series of this richly coloured species.</p>

<p class='c006'>This remarkable species must be very rare, as I never saw it in any part of the New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Guinea district that I visited; nor was it seen during the exploration, a few years ago, by

<p class='c006'>The specimens above quoted agree well with Cramer‚Äôs figures. The female from the
Sulla Islands differs only in having more yellow towards the anal angle of the lower wings.
The specimens figured by Cramer in pls. 10, 11, under the name of ‚Äú<i>Hypolitus</i>‚Äù seem
to be a remarkable variety, in which the female has much of the character of the male.
Messrs. Doubleday and G. R. Gray have adopted <i>Panthous</i> as the specific name of this
insect; but this name was first used by Linn√¶us for the female of <i>Priamus</i> only, in the
10th ed. of the ‚ÄòSystema Natur√¶‚Äô (1758). Clerck (in 1759) adopted the name, but supposed
he had found the male in the female of <i>Remus</i>. Linn√¶us, in Mus. Lud. Ulric. (1764),
and in the 12th ed. of the ‚ÄòSystema Natur√¶‚Äô (1766), adopts this error, so far as referring
to Clerck‚Äôs two figures; but in both these works his description refers only to the
female of <i>P. Priamus</i>, indicating that the supposed other sex (<i>P. Remus</i>) was not known
to him personally. The name of <i>Panthous</i> must therefore altogether drop, it having been
applied to this species only through a double error‚Äîfirst, that of Linn√¶us, in supposing
his <i>Panthous</i> to be distinct from <i>Priamus</i>, and then that of Clerck, in thinking that a
female <i>Remus</i> was the male of the Linnean <i>Panthous</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Male</i>: upper wings elongate, triangular, glossy black, quite uniform and immaculate;
the outer margin delicately white-marked at the termination of the nervures. Lower
wings yellow, as in the allied species, with a black border about the same width as in
<i>O. Pompeus</i> on the outer and abdominal margins, narrower on the inner margin; the
posterior scalloping of the yellow patch not so deep as in <i>O. Pompeus</i>, and having a
spot at the anal angle connected more or less with the margin.</p>

<p class='c006'>The under surface differs from that of <i>O. Pompeus</i> by the ashy margins of the veins
of the upper wings being entirely absent, and in having much less white on the outer
edge. There are no submarginal spots except the anal one, much red at the base of the
wings, and no black spots on the abdomen.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Female</i>: this sex varies very much, some having the upper wings immaculate, while
others have the veins about the end of the discoidal cell broadly margined with whitish.
The marginal series of spots on the lower wings vary as they do in <i>O. Pompeus</i> and <i>O.
Amphrisius</i>. The best distinction from <i>O. Pompeus</i> (‚ôÄ) seems to be the more elongated
wings, the less crenellated margin, and the more produced outer angle of the lower wings.
The yellow patch is also of a deeper colour both on the upper and under surfaces.</p>

and was for some time inclined to place it among the Papilios. It agrees, however, far
better with <i>Ornithoptera</i> in the form and stoutness of the wings, the long stout and
curved antenn√¶, the red collar and patches at the base of the wings beneath, the abdominal
fold, and the flight and general appearance. It is powerful on the wing, and
occasionally settles on the ground in damp sunny places. It inhabits the interior of
North-west Borneo and the mountains of West Sumatra. The female is unknown. It
is peculiar in the great length of the discoidal cell of the wings and its altogether
unique style of coloration, and must be considered as the type of a distinct group of
the genus <i>Ornithoptera</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Bornean form differs from that of Java by its larger size, and on the under surface
by the three middle lunules being formed of a violet line only, with scarcely a trace of
red beneath it, and by the orange-red lunules both at the anal and outer angles being
divided (not margined) by a violet line. The scales sprinkled at the base of the lower
wings are white and blue, and are neither so dense nor do they extend so far as the
yellowish scales of the Java specimens. In all these particulars the Sumatra specimens
are somewhat intermediate, but approach most to those of Borneo. This is one of the
examples which show the isolation of Java, notwithstanding its proximity to Sumatra.</p>

myself. Each form varies considerably, both individually and locally; yet there are
none intermediate between the two. I consider them, therefore, as presenting a fine
instance of dimorphism; and I also believe that the second form mimics <i>P. Coon</i>, for
reasons which I have explained at p. 21.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Remarks.</i>‚ÄîEver since it was discovered that the insects figured by the old authors as
<i>P. Anceus</i>, <i>P. Agenor</i>, <i>P. Achates</i>, &#38;c. were varying females of <i>P. Memnon</i> and <i>P. Androgeus</i>,
the whole of these were very naturally concluded to belong to one varying species.
An examination of many extensive collections, however, has convinced me that the continental
forms, on the one hand, and the insular ones, on the other, can be readily distinguished,
and really form two very well-marked species. The red lunules at the anal
region beneath characterize all specimens from India (<i>Androgeus</i>, Cr.), while these are
entirely absent in all the insular specimens (<i>Memnon</i>, Cr.); and the same characteristic
difference can be traced in a greater or less degree throughout all the infinitely varying
female specimens. My specimen from Malacca has a faint trace only on the upper surface
of the characteristic red mark at the base of the anterior wings; in other respects it
resembles the continental individuals. This form mimics the Indian form of <i>P. Coon</i>
(<i>P. Doubledayi</i>, Wall.).</p>

and I therefore unhesitatingly place these supposed species under one name. The male
of <i>P. Emalthion</i> very closely resembles the next species (<i>P. Deiphontes</i>), and the 2nd
form of female (<i>P. Rumanzovia</i>, Eschsch.) as closely resembles the female of the same
species; so that there can be no doubt that Godardt was right in describing them as
the sexes of his <i>P. Floridor</i>. The female figured in the British Museum Catalogue is
intermediate between these, but has more of the characters of the male; and it is to be
remarked that both these forms of female have arrived in Europe accompanied by the
same male. I am therefore obliged to reduce by one the hitherto received species of

or absence of a pale patch on the uppers, in the brown submarginal marks on the lower
wings, in the form and extent of the yellow band, and in the size of the specimens. The
most extreme forms, as well as the intermediate ones, are often found in one locality and
in company with each other, indicating that over the above range continual intermixture
probably takes place, and thus prevents any one form from becoming specialized in a
restricted area. The two following modifications of it, however, have acquired perfect
stability, each in a large island situated on the extreme limits of the species. I therefore
consider them to be distinct, though the actual differences are but small.</p>

<p class='c006'>The continental specimens of <i>P. Pammon</i> have all considerably developed tails in both
sexes; the insular specimens on the other hand, (which I treat as a separate species),
have only a prominent tooth or very short tail in the males. The females also differ
considerably, presenting an analogous but distinct series of forms. In the true <i>P. Pammon</i>
the males are very constant; but the females exist under three distinct forms, each
of them presenting more or less numerous varieties, viz.:‚Äî</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st form</i> of female. Tab. II. fig. 3.</p>

<p class='c006'>This exactly resembles the male, except in the possession of a distinct ocellus at the
anal angle on the upper surface. Rarely a variety occurs having in addition a submarginal
row of red lunules, indicating a slight approximation towards some varieties of the
second form.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2nd form</i> of female (<i>P. Polytes</i>). Tab. II. fig. 5.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is by far the most common form of female. A variety of this rarely occurs, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>wants the red patch at the anal angle, and has the white patch formed of a row of spots
all situated a little below the discoidal cell. This is the nearest approach to the first
form.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3rd form</i> of female (<i>P. Romulus</i>, Cram. Pap. Ex. t. 43. f. A; <i>P. Mutius</i>, Fab., Boisd.
Sp. G√©n. p. 270; <i>P. Hector</i> ‚ôÄ, De Haan). Tab. II. fig. 6.</p>

<p class='c006'>This not uncommon Indian butterfly I consider to be a third form of the female of
<i>P. Pammon</i>. I was first led to suspect this by finding that no males of it are known
(the male and female from Ceylon, noted in the British Museum List, I have ascertained
to be both females), nor have I been able to find any after an examination of the chief
collections in England. It is also to be observed that it has been received from no
locality which is not also inhabited by <i>P. Pammon</i>; there is no other known Indian
butterfly that can possibly be the other sex of it; and lastly, it agrees very closely with
the second form of female (<i>P. Polytes</i>) in all its details of form, texture, and neuration;
and though at first sight having a very different aspect, specimens are to be found which
by a very slight modification could be changed so as to resemble that form. I am therefore
quite satisfied in my own mind that I am right in sinking this species into a form of
<i>P. Pammon</i>. I have already stated my opinion that it mimics <i>P. Hector</i>, with which,
however, it has no affinity. The resemblance was such as to induce De Haan to place it
as the female of that species.</p>

This is very rare in the islands. I found one specimen only in Timor, which I took ‚Äú<i>in

<p class='c006'><i>2nd form</i> of female (<i>P. Polyphontes</i> ‚ôÄ, De Haan). Tab. II. fig. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>Like the 2nd form of <i>P. Pammon</i> ‚ôÄ; but has the pale portion of the anterior wing of
a much lighter colour, and not extending so far towards the base of the wing; the white
spot on the hind wings is more rounded, and has always a rather large portion within the
cell. This form is to some extent local, not existing, I believe, in Sumatra, where it is
replaced by the next.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3rd form</i> of female (<i>P. Theseus</i>, Cr.; <i>P. Antiphus</i> ‚ôÄ, De Haan). Tab. II. fig. 7.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is well characterized by the entire absence of the white spot from the hind wings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>The red spots and lunules remain; but in some specimens only those in the anal region
are visible, and these have a very close resemblance to <i>P. Antiphus</i>. This is also a local

next the anal margin, are two irregular blue lunules, with a red lunule at the anal angle
and a smaller one lower down beneath the second blue lunule.</p>

<p class='c006'>Resembles very closely <i>P. Erectheus</i> ‚ôÄ; but the white patch on the hind wings does

<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>closely followed by two males of the ordinary form; they were watched for some time,
the males hovering over the females in the manner usual before pairing; and the three
were then captured at one stroke of the net. This occurred three years after the capture
of the specimen figured by Mr. Hewitson, and at once convinced me that these puzzling
specimens were an additional form of female to a well-known male. The fact that the
only females known of an allied species (<i>P. Tydeus</i>) are intermediate between these forms
confirms this determination.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upper side:‚Äîthe band of spots across the fore wings is faintly marked, or more
frequently quite absent; the grey lines bordering the nervures at the apex are more distinct;
on the hind wings, the first three indentations of the whitish patch are followed
by faint powdered lunules of the same colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>Under side:‚Äîthe apex of the fore wings is strongly marked with grey lines between
the nervures, but has generally no spots; on the hind wings there is a curved submarginal
band of lunules across the wing, viz., at the anal angle a large irregular red lunulate
spot with a blue and a grey mark above it‚Äî2nd, a larger grey lunule with an angular
blue mark below it, and a red lunule nearer the margin‚Äî3rd, a similar grey lunule and
blue mark‚Äî4th, a larger grey lunule, and a smaller blue mark with a faint red lunule
below‚Äî5th, a grey lunule and a faint blue dash below‚Äî6th, a blue lunule with a faint
grey mark above‚Äî7th, a blue lunule with a very faint mark above it. These vary somewhat
in different specimens, but the whole series can always be traced.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st form</i> of female.</p>

<p class='c006'>Scarcely distinguishable from the typical female of the last species: the blue lunules

Abdomen yellow; under side black.</p>

<p class='c034'><i>Hab.</i> Dorey (New Guinea) (<i>Wall.</i>)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Remarks.</i>‚ÄîThis specimen was taken in company with two males, as before mentioned.
An insect, described by M. Montrouzier as the female of his <i>P. Godartii</i> (from Woodlark
Island), agrees very closely with this, and is no doubt the female of the same species, or a
closely allied one which he puts in his list as <i>P. Ormenus</i>. The fact, therefore, that this
peculiar pale form of female <i>Papilio</i> has been found in five islands, from no one of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>is a male insect known which can be mated with it, except those of the <i>Ormenus</i>-form
(which always occur in the same places), may, in conjunction with the observation already
given of the companionship of the two forms, be taken to prove that this is really a case
of polymorphism. I believe also it will be found that these extreme departures from
the typical form of a species are connected with mimetic resemblances and the safety of
the individuals. We have already seen that the extreme forms of <i>P. Memnon</i> ‚ôÄ and
<i>P. Pammon</i> ‚ôÄ respectively resemble other species which from their habits and abundance
seem to have some peculiar immunity from danger. In this case also there is a
resemblance to quite a different family of butterflies, the Morphid√¶. In form, coloration,
and general appearance these pale-coloured Papilios resemble species of the genus
<i>Drusilla</i>; and the same genus is also imitated by other butterflies‚Äîone of these, <i>Melanitis
Agondas</i> ‚ôÄ, having been actually confounded with <i>Drusilla bioculata</i> as the same
species, so great is the resemblance. This fact of species of several genera imitating
the Drusillas would indicate that they have some special immunities which make it
advantageous to other insects to be mistaken for them; and their habits confirm this
opinion. They have all a very similar style of dress, and fly very slowly, low down in
damp woods, often settling on the ground or on rotten wood; and they are exceedingly
abundant in individuals. Now these are the general characteristics of all groups which
are the subjects of imitation; and we may therefore presume, when we see forms departing
widely from the general appearance of their close relations, and resembling closely
other groups with which they have no affinity, that what we must call <i>accidental</i> variations
have been accumulated and rendered definite by natural selection for the protection
and benefit of those forms.</p>

I think, be separated, though very abnormal in colouring. <i>P. Evan</i>, Db., is a closely allied

though it has been hitherto placed in another section of the genus.</p>

<p class='c006'>This may be a distinct species, but is more probably a case of dimorphism. The two

<p class='c011'>This small but interesting genus differs somewhat from <i>Papilio</i> in the neuration of
the wings, but is best distinguished by the longitudinal fold and great elongation of the
hind wings. The species frequent water, often settling on the edges of rills, or hovering
over pools and rivulets in the sunshine. The few species known are all very closely
allied, and might with equal propriety have been considered as local forms of one
species. Three have been already described, and I have therefore thought it better to
add one more, than to attempt to reduce those which have been generally accepted as
species to a lower rank.</p>

<p class='c037'>Represents six remarkable species of Papilio not before figured. N.B. Except in fig. 1, the right side
shows the upper surface, and the left side the under surface of the same insect.</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 1. <i>Papilio Thule</i>, male. The upper surfaces of two varieties or local forms of this species are figured.
The right side represents the form found in New Guinea, the left side that obtained in Waigiou.
It resembles <i>Danais sobrina</i>, Bd., which inhabits the same countries, and varies in a somewhat
similar manner (see pages 20 and 63).</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 3. <i>Papilio √Ünigma</i>, male, from Sumatra (see page 60). This species was named as above, from
its puzzling resemblance to <i>Papilio Paradoxa</i>, which is found in the same districts. Both
species appear to mimic <i>Eupl≈ìa Midamus</i> (see page 20).</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 2. <i>Papilio Miletus</i>, male, from Celebes (see page 65). This species and the next exhibit in a
striking manner the abruptly curved wing peculiar to Celebes. Figs. 5 and 6 represent species
almost equally remarkable in this respect.</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 4. <i>Papilio Telephus</i>, male, from Celebes (see page 67).</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 5. <i>Papilio Androcles</i>, male, from Celebes (see page 63).</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 6. <i>Papilio Gigon</i>, female, from Celebes (see page 59).</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Plate VIII.</span></h3>

<p class='c037'>Illustrates, by comparative outlines of the anterior wings, the local modification of form in the Papilios
of Celebes as compared with those of the surrounding islands. In each pair of outlines, the
upper one represents a species peculiar to Celebes, while the one beneath it shows the most
closely allied species or variety from any of the surrounding islands. (For details, see page 16.)
The following are the names of the species:‚Äî</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 1. <i>Papilio Gigon</i>, from Celebes; <i>P. Demolion</i>, from Java.</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 2. <i>Papilio Macedon</i>, from Celebes; <i>P. Peranthus</i>, from Java.</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 3. <i>Papilio Androcles</i>, from Celebes; <i>P. Antiphates</i>, from Borneo.</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 4. <i>Papilio Telephus</i>, from Celebes; <i>P. Jason</i>, from Sumatra.</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 5. <i>Papilio Miletus</i>, from Celebes; <i>P. Sarpedon</i>, from Java.</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 6. <i>Papilio Agamemnon</i>, var., from Celebes; <i>P. Agamemnon</i>, var., from Sumatra.</p>

<p class='c037'>Represents four species not before figured,
belonging to the most brilliantly coloured
group of Eastern Papilios, and illustrating local
modifications of form. N.B. The right
side shows the upper surface, and the left side
the under surface of the same insect.</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 1. <i>Papilio Pericles</i>, male, from Timor (see
page 45).</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 2. <i>Papilio Macedon</i>, male, from Celebes
(see page 45). This species exhibits in
a marked manner the strongly arched
wings characteristic of those from
Celebes, as contrasted with those represented
at figs. 1 and 3, from other
islands (see pages 16, 17, and 18).</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 3. <i>Papilio Philippus</i>, female, from Ceram
(see page 45).</p>

<p class='c034'>Fig. 4. <i>Papilio Blumei</i>, male, from the north of
Celebes (see page 46). This also exhibits
the arched wing, as compared
with its ally from the Moluccas (fig. 3).</p>
